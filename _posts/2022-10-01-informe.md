Systems development is the process of taking a set of business requirements and, through a series of structured stages, translating these into an operational IT system. 

The stages vary according to the development approach being used – described more fully in Chapter 2, ‘Lifecycle types and their rationales’ – but typically would include the activities shown in Figure 1.1, including: a feasibility study, to see if the project is worthwhile ; requirements engineering to analyse the business need and specify the users’ requirements ; design of the system to meet the users’ needs ; development of the software needed to meet the requirements ; testing of the software ; implementation of the solution.
